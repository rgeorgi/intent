him he defended with weapons .

not can we write nor with words say all those wonders .
then answered they him doubtingly .
he then his army in two divided .

whether thou now such-gen anything do can .
whether he would the wickedest men follow .
surely us two will manifest our lord savior christ his power .
had the king his army in two divided .

if this bold bishop killed not will be .

that they him out should throw .
he swore that he all his castles should give up .
god commanded abraham .
then went the bishop into that other church .
we them feared .
sn is he sn righted .
god him made then garments of skins .
he gave the oppressed people rest .
i not destroy the castle .
that many persons antecrist self not-ever his eyes not saw .
that one the holy man were that same horse again bring should .
and he many monasteries and churches in that land built .
and we must again give our souls our creator .
him there the young king the crossing prevent could .
if them then god rightly and severely judge will .
that we us self clean and undefiled him prepare .
then may him the lord free .
that him his enemies were following .
many stories him told the permians both of their own country .
not saw him no man so little angry .
he would drive out a prince .
that him his enemies were following .
that the danes him neg could the harvest refuse .
then desired her that and it took .
so it greater leechcraft needs .
then happened it that at the wedding .
in the time before it happened so,that he stood .
and him like her virtues-nom/acc and thanked god .
god them wrought then garments of skin .
therefore we shall with all mind and power to god turn .
